# Notatizer

Simple tool to notarize a software by drag and drop

### Contribution

This tool is very simple and can be improved, and the UI is not very nice. PRs are welcome :) 

## How to use
See the release page on GitHub for the latest app version. You can simply download this and double-click to run

Replace the "default" profile name by yours. This setting will be saved locally for the next run.

Drag your .app, .bundle or .plugin file. The tool will zip, notarize, and staple it. If something goes wrong, you will see it in the log.
